# IslandsInterface

Apart from the Elm code this is based on the example from [Functional Web
Development with Elixir, OTP, and
Phoenix](https://pragprog.com/book/lhelph/functional-web-development-with-elixir-otp-and-phoenix)
by Lance Halvorsen.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
